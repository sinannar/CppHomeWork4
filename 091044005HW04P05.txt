USÝNG C++ WHEN I TRY TO CREATE OBJECTS,KEEP ALL THINGS TOGETHER AND IT IS VERY HELPFUL THINGS WHILE I AM WRITING CODES
BECAUSE SEEING ALL THINGS ABOUT OBJECT,AND THEY ARE TOGETHER,MAKE C++ CLASSES MORE MEANINGFULL THAN C OBJECTS
ALSO IF WE DECIDED TO USE C++ CLASSES,FOR FUNCTIONS,THERE IS LESS PARAMETERS
WE CAN DIRECT ACCESS TO OBJECT MEMBER IN FUNCTION AND WE CALL FUNCTIONS AS OBJECT MEMBER
AND ENCAPSULATION BECAME MORE MEANINGFULL THAN WE LEARNT IT C
LOOKING WORLD FROM THE SIDE OF OBJECTs IS ALSO MORE MEANINGFUL THAN LOOKING FROM PROBLEM SIDE LIKE ALGORITHMs
OF COURSE WE ARE WROTE THESE CODES FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS BUT ITS MUCH MORE EASIER IF WE LOOK THINGS AS OBJECTS

IN CONCLUSION,WE CAN WRITE ALL THINGS IN C IF WE WROTE IT IN C++,BUT IT IS MUCH MORE EASIER TO READ AND TO CODE IT IN C++
